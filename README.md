Smoking Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing smoking behavior patterns using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into smoking prevalence across different age groups, genders, and regions to support data-driven understanding and reporting.

Problem Statement
Smoking-related data is often available but not easily interpretable. This project aims to transform raw data into meaningful visual insights that help identify high-risk demographic segments and overall trends.

Objectives
- Analyze smoker vs non-smoker distribution
- Identify patterns across age group, gender, and region
- Create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard
- Enable quick insight generation through visual analytics

Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning and Preparation)
- CSV Dataset

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a cleaned, publicly available dataset prepared for analytical and learning purposes. It includes demographic attributes such as age, gender, region, and smoking status.

Dashboard Features
- Interactive slicers for age group, gender, and region
- Comparison of smokers vs non-smokers
- Visual analysis of demographic trends
- Clean and structured layout for easy interpretation

Key Insights
- Smoking prevalence is higher in the 25–40 age group
- Male smokers represent a larger proportion compared to females
- Certain regions consistently show higher smoking rates
- Clear demographic patterns emerge when filtered by age and gender

Files Included
- hospital_bi.pbix – Power BI dashboard files
